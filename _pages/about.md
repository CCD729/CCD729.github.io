I am a game developer, a software engineer, a designer, an FPS lover, a game streamer, and a current graduate student at UC Santa Cruz studying Games and Playable Media. I am passionate about creating fascinating experiences for players and making brilliant ideas come alive on the screen, with an interest in interactive design and adaptive game AI. I love to explore new technologies and implementations of interesting mechanics when I make my games, and I enjoy working with teams to collaborate on many great projects on larger scales.

I developed many games in different genres and scales either solo or with teams. Our undergraduate capstone game _KANGARUMBLE_ won the Capstone Production Award and Peer Choice Award (overall excellence) at UCSC Games Showcase 2020.

Last fall, during my first term in grad school, I worked with Microsoft dev team to develop a mod for _Age of Empires 4_. At the same time, I helped Professor Brian Hansen's research on game audio generation with neural network processing by creating a Unity project and connecting the project to the trained model through Open Sound Control (OSC). 

On the design side, I designed game mechanics and system for my shooter game and the Age 4 mod. I also designed a level for my first Celeste mod.  I participated in the design process in almost all my team projects.

Currently I'm learning and working on a new Unreal Engine 5.1 first-person game, and the prototype level looks good :)
