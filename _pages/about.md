I am a game developer and designer, current graduate student at UC Santa Cruz studying Games and Playable Media. I graduated from UC Santa Cruz with Computer Science: Computer Game Design major. Through years of game developing experience, I developed an interest in interactive design and adaptive game AI. I created a goal-oriented action planner exploring possibilities of AI to adapt to relatively abstract human input and plan dynamically. Currently I am researching neural network processing's application on game audio generation with a team.  I also want to make more games and research immersion technologies for better simulation/response to human emotion.
