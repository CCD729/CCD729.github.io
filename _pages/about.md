Hello there! I'm Erwang, a game engineer and technical designer. As a gamer, I love FPS, roguelike, and puzzle games. As a developer, I have professional developing experience in **C++ (Unreal)/C# (Unity)** and love exploring new technologies and approaches.

I have experience in **systems, gameplay, and AI programming**, as well as **system, combat, and level design**. I worked on games and research in different scales, solo or with teams. I worked on an AoE modding project with _Microsoft (World's Edge)_, an Unreal Engine 5 (C++) R&D sound project with _Dolby Labs_, an AI-generated SFX research shown on _GameSoundCon 2022_, and an AI narrative curator research for RPG using OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo.

[**METAL BEANS**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2792960/METAL_BEANS/ "METAL BEANS on Steam") , our latest 3D low-poly roguelite action-arcade game, is coming on Steam on March 25, 2024!

Here is an introductory video that will help you know me better :)
