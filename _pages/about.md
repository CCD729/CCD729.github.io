I am a gameplay engineer, a technical designer, a level designer, an FPS lover, a game streamer, and a current graduate student at UC Santa Cruz studying Games and Playable Media. I am passionate about creating fascinating experiences for players and making brilliant ideas come alive on the screen, with interest in interactive design and adaptive game AI. I love exploring new technologies and learning to implement creative mechanics when I make my games, and I enjoy working with teams to collaborate on many great projects on larger scales.

I developed many games in different genres and scales solo or with teams. Our undergraduate capstone game _KANGARUMBLE_ won the Capstone Production Award and Peer Choice Award (overall excellence) at UCSC Games Showcase 2020.

During my first term in grad school, I worked with the Microsoft dev team to develop a mod for _Age of Empires 4_. At the same time, I helped Professor Brian Hansen's research on audio game generation with neural network processing by creating a Unity project and connecting the project to the trained model through Open Sound Control (OSC). 

On the design side, I designed game mechanics and systems for my shooter game and the Age 4 mod. I also designed levels while carefully tweaking player's experiences for a _Celeste_ map and a _Portal 2_ map. I love participating in the design process even if I am not the official designer of the team.

I am learning and working on a new Unreal Engine 5.1 first-person game, and I have made a prototype level! Unreal is a powerful engine, and I will be on this project for a while :) I look forward to joining teams in the industry as a gameplay engineer, level designer, or other positions that fit my skill set so that I can put my skills into impactful work and create entertaining experiences with everyone!
