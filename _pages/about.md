Hello there! I'm Erwang, a gameplay engineer and technical game designer. As a gamer, I love FPS, roguelike and puzzle games a lot. While as a developer, I'm passionate about creating fascinating experiences for players and making brilliant ideas come alive on the screen. I love exploring new technologies and learning to implement creative mechanics, and I enjoy working with teams to share the joy while keeping the workflow healthy.

I designed and developed many games in different genres and scales solo or with teams. During my academic career, I had the chance to participate in projects that collaborated with _Microsoft (World's Edge)_ and _Dolby Labs_, and researches which one of them was presented at _GameSoundCon_ 2022.

Here is a introductory video that will help you know me better :)
