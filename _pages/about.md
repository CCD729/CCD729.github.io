I am a game developer, a designer, an FPS lover, a game streamer, and also a current graduate student at UC Santa Cruz studying Games and Playable Media. I am passionate about creating fascinating experiences for players and making brilliant ideas come alive on the screen, with an interest in interactive design and adaptive game AI. I love to explore implementations of interesting mechanics when I make my own games, and I enjoy working with teams to collaborate on many great projects on larger scales. I also created a goal-oriented action planner to test the possibilities of AI to adapt to abstract human input and plan dynamically. Currently, I'm helping a team research game audio generation with neural network processing.
