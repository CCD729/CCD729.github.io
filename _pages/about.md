I am a game developer and designer, graduated from UC Santa Cruz in Computer Science: Computer Game Design major. Through years of game developing experience, I developed interest in interactivity technologies and adaptive game AI, and created an goal-oriented action planner exploring possibilities of AI to dynamically plan and adapt to relatively abstract human input. I would like to create more games and further research in immersion technologies for better simulation/response to human emotion. 

The construction of this page is still in progress.
