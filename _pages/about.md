I am a game developer and designer, graduated from UC Santa Cruz with Computer Science: Computer Game Design major. Through years of game developing experience, I developed an interest in interactivity technologies and adaptive game AI. I created a goal-oriented action planner exploring possibilities of AI to adapt to relatively abstract human input and plan dynamically. I want to make more games and research immersion technologies for better simulation/response to human emotion.
