## [Range Shooter Plus](https://ccd729.itch.io/range-shooter-plus)

_Range Shooter Plus_ is a First-Person Shooter powered by Unity3D. Player chooses their weapons and either play without rules with sandbox targets or complete the built-in replayable scored trials and challenge for better scores. 

This game was created as a experimental playground for new learned skills as I wanted to implement several features inspired by many shooters I've played recently. Started from a course project _Shooting Range Simulator_, I overhauled core mechanics, prototyped new game logic, and reworked animation/physics/effects/etc. This project is a solo project. Other than several free-to-use assets including textures/vectors and unedited sound samples, most content is my own work. The game grew to be more complete than I imagined, so I decided to publish and share it on Itch.io.
