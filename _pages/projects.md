King of Kings is an Age of Empires 4 mod that illustrates a capture-the-flag 2-player scenario in a crafted map. 
<br><br>
This was an independent study project where we connected to Age 4 dev team members (from World's Edge Studio, a studio of Xbox Game Studios, Microsoft), including Senior Producer Seb Grinke and Yasemin Kuyumcu. After generating a good idea around the Capture-the-Flag game mode, our team worked closely with the dev team and the modding community throughout the development process. As the lead gameplay programmer, I learned to write Lua script with Age 4's content editor and implemented the game mode prototype. After integrating the crafted map, I ported the game mode into a map scenario. I tweaked the details around core mechanics, including winning condition, objective UI, and flag respawn/tracking in fog-of-war. We conducted two playtests in an observation room and several with peer volunteers from all skill levels. Then the mod is published to the Age 4 mod's page with live updates and is ready for the players to enjoy.

A singleplayer first-person shooter where players choose their weapons and either play without rules with sandbox targets or complete the built-in replayable scored trials and challenges for better scores. 
<br><br>
This game was created as an experimental playground for newly learned skills as I wanted to implement several features inspired by many games I've played recently. Starting from a course project _Shooting Range Simulator_, I overhauled core mechanics, prototyped new game logic, and reworked animation/physics/effects/etc. This project is a solo project. Most content is my work, besides several free-to-use assets like textures/vectors and unedited sound samples. The game grew to have more content than I imagined and functioned well, so I decided to publish and share it on Itch.io.

A local multiplayer turn-based party platformer where up to 4 players compete as their unique choices of kangaroos. Players can only move during their turn, and for every stomp they score, their turn gets shorter. Action heats up as tension builds all the way to the final stomp, where only one kangaroo will be victorious!
<br><br>
This game was my capstone project, took a year to build with a team of 12 students. As the lead programmer, I was in charge of full-purpose coding and team code management. Starting from the pitch, I prototyped and contributed to physics, gameplay, menu/UI, character selection, cross-platform support, version control, code integration, optimization, etc. I also modified Unity's new input system package code to adapt our gamepad and split-keyboard control scheme with cross-platform support. The _KANGGANG_ worked as a whole and put our efforts and love together sprint from sprint to create this game that we are all proud of.
<br><br>
_Game awarded Capstone Production Award and Peer Choice Award (Overall Excellence) at UCSC Games Showcase 2020._

An endless sidescroller where the player accompanies a ninja on his unending journey to the end of the world. The player navigates through the skies, leaping across clouds and evading inky threats while exploring temples to piece together the story of the ninja's odyssey.
<br><br>
This game was 3-person teamwork over three months. We started with a simple endless runner (game state 1) and pitched new content to enrich the gameplay and story. I prototyped and implemented core mechanics into new states, integrated teamwork weekly with version control, and collaborated code optimization with team members.
<br><br>
_Game nominated and showcased at UCSC Games Showcase 2019._

An algorithmic soundtrack generator with goal-oriented action planner that responds to user input and chooses a BGM combination for a Unity Learn Microgame.
<br><br>
The research goal was to test a general model that responds to human input of desired quantified attributes and dynamically plan the best suitable progressive combination from predefined assets with weighted attribute values. In this project, these were music instrument patterns and values for loudness, emotion, and tempo. Inspired by the behavior of AI in _F.E.A.R._, I decided to write an A* planner with only the goal value appointed and let it dynamically adjust the following steps based on the current state and average mathematical deviation from the goal (as heuristic). Theoretically, this model could be expanded and applied to any project with a demand of input-responsive customized experience with quantifiable factors and is possible to combine with other technologies and adapt to more complicated human inputs.
<br><br>
I served as the audio designer and AI Programmer, created layers of tracks in sound base (with PureData), and implemented AI planner (A* based search). Then I generated Unity plugin with hvcc compiler and modified the original project to integrate the sound generator.
