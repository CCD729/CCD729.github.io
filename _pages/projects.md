## [Range Shooter Plus](https://ccd729.itch.io/range-shooter-plus)

<br>
A first-person shooter where player chooses their weapons and either play without rules with sandbox targets or complete the built-in replayable scored trials and challenge for better scores. 
<br>
This game was created as an experimental playground for new learned skills as I wanted to implement several features inspired by many games I've played recently. Started from a course project _Shooting Range Simulator_, I overhauled core mechanics, prototyped new game logic, and reworked animation/physics/effects/etc. This project is a solo project. Other than several free-to-use assets including textures/vectors and unedited sound samples, most content is my own work. The game grew to be more complete than I imagined, so I decided to publish and share it on Itch.io.


## [KANGARUMBLE](https://www.kangarumble.com/)

<br>
A local multiplayer turn-based party platformer where up to 4 players compete as their unique choices of kangaroos. Players can only move during their turn, and for every stomp they score, their turn gets shorter. Action heats up as tension builds all the way to the final stomp, where only one kangaroo will be victorious!
<br>
This game was my capstone project, took a year to build with a team of 12 students. As the lead programmer, I was in charge of full-purpose coding and team code management. Starting from the pitch, I prototyped and contributed to physics, gameplay, menu/UI, character selection, cross-platform support, version control, code integration and optimization, etc. I also modified Unity's new input system package code in order to adapt our gamepad and split-keyboard control scheme with cross platform support. The _KANGGANG_ worked as a whole and put our efforts and love together sprint from sprint to create this game that we are all proud of.

_Game awarded Capstone Production Award and Peer Choice Award (Overall Excellence) at UCSC Games Showcase 2020._


## [Skyward Odyssey](https://hpaing.itch.io/skyward-odyssey)

<br>
An endless sidescroller where the player accompanies a ninja on his unending journey to the end of the world. The player navigates through the skies, leaping across clouds and evading inky threats while exploring temples to piece together the story of the ninja's odyssey.
<br>
This game was a 3-person team work over 3 months. We statred with a simple endless runner (game state 1) and pitched new contents to enrich the gameplay and story. I prototyped and implemented core mechanics into new states, integrated team work weekly with version control, and collaborated code optimization with team members.

_Game nominated and showcased at UCSC Games Showcase 2019._

## Smart-Tuney Karting

<br>
An algorithmic soundtrack generator with goal-oriented action planner that responds to user input and chooses a BGM combination for a Unity Learn Microgame.
<br>
The research goal was to test a general model that responds to human input of desired quantified attributes and dynamically plan the best fit progressive combination from predefined assets with weighted attribute values, which in this project, were music instrument patterns and values for loudness, emotion and tempo. I was interested in the behavior of AI in F.E.A.R. and decided to plan with A* with only the goal value appointed and let the planner dynamically plan and adjust next steps based on the current state and average mathematical deviation from the goal as heuristic. Theoretically this model could be applied to all scales of projects with the need of input-responsive customized experience and quantifiable factors, yet has the potential to combine with other technologies and adapt to more complicated human inputs. 
<br>
I served as the audio designer and AI Programmer, created layers of tracks in sound base (with PureData), and implemented AI planner (A* based search). Then I generated Unity plugin with hvcc compiler and modified the original project to integrate sound generator.
